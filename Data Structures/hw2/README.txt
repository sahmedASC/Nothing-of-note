DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CREATIVE STATISTIC:
Please be concise!
<The custom argument was to output only the rooms that freshman
would most likely take. Freshmen usually take 1000 level courses
so I output an organized file with data neatly formatted.
This gives the user an idea of where freshmen will be spending
most of their academic hours.>
