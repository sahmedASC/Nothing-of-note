use the following installation procedure.

Note
----
* If you use a SMB (NetBIOS network) printer as a shared printer on the server 
  computer, use the Add Printer Wizard, and select "Network printer" when installing
  the fax driver.
* If a message prompting you to restart your computer is displayed when using 
  the installer, make sure to restart your computer. If you do not restart your
  computer, existing drivers may not operate correctly.
* If you are using the printer auto-creation mechanism in a Citrix 
Å@XenApp (Presentation Server)  environment, you may not be able 
  to correctly install this driverusing the Installer. If so, restart the XenApp 
  Server computer and check the Printers folder (Printers and Faxes folder in Windows 
  Server 2003). If any existing printer icons are no longer displayed,
  re-install the relevant fax drivers in the XenApp Server computer
  using the Add Printer Wizard in the Printers folder.
  Then, before starting the Installer to install this driver, 
  disconnect all client printers from all the ICA sessions using 
  the ICA Client Printer Configuration utility. After installing 
  the driver, restart the ICA Client Printer Configuration utility 
  and reconnect the printers.

To install using the Installer:
1. In the \FAX\us_eng\x64 folder, double-click the Setup.exe 
   icon to start the installation process.
2. In the first dialog box of the Fax Driver Setup Wizard, click the Next
   button, and then follow the instructions on the screen.
3. Select Manually Set Port to Install, and then click the Next button.
4. If the dialog box to select items to install is displayed, select Raster/

  on your computer and then do the installation, change the properties of the 
  "instdrv.ini" and "uninst.ini" files following the procedure below:
  Right-click the file and select Properties, clear the Read-only check box, 
  and then select the Archive check box.

  environment, it is necessary to install Canon Driver Information Assist
  Service in the server computer in order to set up the printer configuration
  automatically or to use the Department ID Management feature.

  message which asks if you want to change the Windows Firewall setting is 
  displayed during the installation.
  - If you select Yes, Windows Firewall will be configured to unblock the 
    connection for Canon Driver Information Assist Service, so that you can

Accessing Help Information
==========================
You can locate additional help for questions you may have regarding your fax 
in the Online Help file provided with the driver. In the fax properties dialog 
box, you can click [Help] to display additional information about every feature 
and option in the fax driver.

Cautions, Limitations and Restrictions
======================================
1. Custom paper sizes are not available for sending a fax.

2. Do not specify more than 1 for the Copies option in the application since 
   the fax may be sent more than once in some applications when the Copies 
   option is specified in the application.

3. When installing with Add Printer from the Printer Folder, the Cannot find 
   Digital Signature message may appear. If this message appears, continue 
   with the installation. The fax driver will install correctly.

4. When using Windows XP/Windows Server 2003/Windows Vista/
   Windows Server 2008/Windows 7 x64 Edition by multiple users, it is not 
   available to use the Department ID Management feature or set up printer 
   configuration automatically.

5. It is necessary to use TCP/IP as a network protocol in order to set up the 
   printer configuration automatically when using a Remote Desktop environment, 
   or when Windows is shared by multiple users.

6. For the iR330-400, only System Version 2.0 (or later) is supported by the 
   fax driver version 1.2 (or later).

7. If double quotation marks or CSV separators are included in any of the items 
   (Such as name and fax numbers) stored in a CSV file, the addresses stored in 
   the file may not be imported to the address book correctly.

8. If you have upgraded your operating system from Windows XP/Windows Server 2003
   to Windows Vista x64 Edition, you will no longer be able to access the address
   book. 
   If this is the case,perform the following procedure.

   1. Copy the address book files (gpfax.adr and gpfax.idx) from the system 
     folder (the default system folder is "C:\Windows") to another folder 
     (e.g. "My Documents"). This step can be carried out before or after you 
     upgrade the system.

   2. After you have upgraded the system, reinstall the fax driver in the new 
     system, open the [Edit Address Book] sheet, click the [Specify a folder] 
     button, and choose the folder you copied the address book files to in 
     step 1 (e.g. "My Documents") as the address book folder.

   3. Click the [Yes] button in the following dialog box.

9. If double quotation marks are included in any of the items (Such as names 
   and fax numbers) stored in an ABK file (*.abk), the addresses stored in the 
   file may not be imported to the address book correctly.

10.When an "@" character is used in the name of the printer, the printer will 
   become unrecognizable by the operating system because of an invalid printer 
   name thus disabling printing, operation and setup.

11.When you log on to an Administrator account that is different from the one 
   used to install the software, you will not be able to access the driver 
   properties with Administrator privileges. To access the driver properties, 
   select [Run as Administrator].

12.In certain applications, thickness of a line can be set to a value smaller 
   than 1pt but the actual thickness in the printout may be equivalent to that 
   of an 1pt line.

13.In a 64-bit environment, the address book cannot be used with certain 
   applications.
   If you are using an application that cannot utilize the address book,
   convert the address book to a CSV file, then import the CSV file into the 
   fax driver as an address book.

14.For Windows Server 2008 installed with Server Core option, the following 
   limitations exist on using the fax driver.
   -You cannot install the driver with the installer. Use the installation 
    options of Windows.
   -Some fax options are not available under local environment or Windows 
    Remote Desktop environment.

15.If the driver version of the client computer is older than that of the print 
   server, the driver settings of the server may not be applied to the client.

16.If you forget the password you have set for [Protect with Password when 
   Exporting Address List] in the [Security Settings] dialog box of the 
   [Special] sheet, you will not be able to export the address list. You can 
   still perform operations other than exporting (browsing, adding, editing, 
   deleting, etc.). If you want to export an address list, you will have to 
   recreate the address list you want to export.

17.There may be cases where the browse, edit, and other functions of the 
   address book cannot be used in older versions of the fax driver.
   -When a version 8.00 or newer driver has been installed then uninstalled, 
    and an older version driver is thereafter installed for the first time. 
   -When an address book created by a version 8.00 or newer driver has been 
    copied into an older version driver or imported into the older version 
    driver using the [Specify a Folder] command.

18.If you are using a printer (AutoCreatedPrinter) created with the "Auto
   Created Client Printer" function of Citrix XenDesktop, you may not be able
   to use the Department ID Management function or the Get Device Status
   function.
   If this is the case, use the Citrix XenDesktop Universal Printer Driver
   (UPD), or select a Standard TCP/IP Port for which the IP address of a
   printer you are actually outputting to has been set.
