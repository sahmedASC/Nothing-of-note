   stitched.
   When using Saddle Stitch function for Booklet Printing, disable the collate
   function of the application.

2. When creating a custom paper size in the Print Server Properties dialog box,
   specify the margins as follows:
   - 0.50cm/0.20in or more

3. When installing with Add Printer from the Printer Folder, the Cannot find
   Digital Signature message may appear. If this message appears, continue
   with the installation.  The printer will install correctly.

4. When you select Paper Type for Select by in the Paper Source sheet, select
   Same Paper for All Pages for Paper Selection if you want to use Tab Paper to
   print a document. If you specify several different paper types to print each
   pages of a document, the print out on the Tab Paper may not be correct.

5. When printing from QuarkXPress, the document may not be printed and blank
   pages are output. In this case, select Disabled for Spooling at Host in the
   Device Settings sheet.

6. When printing a document to which EPS objects are attached, the printed
   output may not be correct.

7. It is necessary to use TCP/IP as a network protocol in order to set up the
   printer configuration automatically when using a Remote Desktop environment,
   or when Windows is shared by multiple users.

8. When inserting inserted sheets into the document, if you accidentally
   specify a drawer that contains tab paper as the paper source for the
   inserted sheets, the paper source automatically returns to the plain paper
   setting.

9. When you use Adobe Illustrator 9.0 or later and do not select the Bitmap
   Printing option, it may take a long time to finish printing, or thin lines
   or characters may be blurred. If you experience such problem, select the
   Bitmap Printing option.

10.If you print a document on a PC with a slow processing speed, it may take a
   long time to finish printing.

11.When you select Disabled for Spooling at Host in the Device Settings sheet,
   specify a cassette as a paper source for booklet printing.

12.If you select Transparency or Label for Paper Type in the Paper Source
   sheet, a message indicating that you cannot print the document unless
   you change the Paper Type may appear. If this message appears, you may
   be able to print a document by deselecting the Offset check box in the
   Finishing sheet.

13.There may be cases where the Custom Paper Type information registered in the
   printer is not acquired correctly when installing the printer driver.
   If so, reacquire the correct information by clicking on the Get Device
   Status button in the Device Settings sheet, or the Get Paper Details button
   in the Paper Type Settings dialog box, displayed by clicking the Settings button
   in the Paper Source sheet.

14.When an "@" character is used in the name of the printer, the printer will
   become unrecognizable by the operating system because of an invalid printer
   name thus disabling printing, operation and setup.

15.If you print a document that has an odd number of pages as a two-sided
   document from an application, the application may automatically insert a
   blank page to bring the number of pages up to an even number. When this
   happens, the blank page inserted by the application is counted up in the
   same way as a printed page.

16.To register the custom paper size you want to use, access the Document
   Properties dialog box from the Printers folder with Administrator privileges, 
   and then specify the paper size in the Custom Paper Size Settings dialog box 
   which is displayed by clicking the Custom Paper Size button in the Page
   Setup sheet.

   used to install the software, you will not be able to access the driver
   properties with Administrator privileges. To access the driver properties,
   select [Run as Administrator].

18.In certain applications, thickness of a line can be set to a value smaller
   than 1pt but the actual thickness in the printout may be equivalent to that
   of an 1pt line.

19.When a document is output at a resolution of 1200 dpi set from an
   application, jaggies in images may be more noticeable than when the
   document is printed at 600 dpi.

20.If you are using a USB connection with the printer to print,
   and cancel a print job that is currently printing from your computer
   using the print spooler, the printer may not return to a ready state.
   In this state, you can print via USB, but not via a network.
   In order to be able to print from a network, cancel the print job from the
   control panel of the printer prior to printing.

21.For Windows Server 2008 x64 installed with Server Core option, the following 
   limitations exist on using the printer driver.

   - You cannot install the driver with the installer. Use the installation
     options of Windows.
   - Some print options are not available under local environment or Windows 
     Remote Desktop environment.

22.If the driver version of the client computer is older than that of the print
   server, the driver settings of the server may not be applied to the client.

25.If you are using a printer (AutoCreatedPrinter) created with the "Auto
   Created Client Printer" function of Citrix XenDesktop, you may not be
   able to use the Department ID Management function or the Get Device
   Status function.

   If this is the case, use the Citrix XenDesktop Universal Printer Driver
   (UPD), or select a Standard TCP/IP Port for which the IP address of a
   printer you are actually outputting to has been set.

   * If you are using the Universal Printer Driver, you may not be able to
   use some printer functions correctly, depending on the environment you
   are using. For a detailed solution, see the next item.

26.If you are using the Citrix XenApp (Presentation Server) or Citrix
   XenDesktop Universal Printer Driver (UPD), you may not be able to use the
   Department ID Management function, Get Device Status function, and/or Edit
   + Preview function, and print settings such as page layout, booklet
   printing, etc. may be invalid.

   If this is the case, with Citrix XenApp (Presentation Server) or Citrix
   XenDesktop in a disconnected state, deselect [Enable advanced printing
   features] in the [Advanced] sheet of the printer properties dialog box of
   the client printer, then connect Citrix XenApp (Presentation Server) or
   Citrix XenDesktop.

   * Depending on the environment you are using, you may not be able to
   perform the above operations in the way described. If this is the case,
   refer to the Citrix website.
