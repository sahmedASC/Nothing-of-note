Overview
========
The ScanGear allows you to scan documents from your computer.


System Requirements
===================
The Canon ScanGear can be used in the following system environments:

* Operating System Software
  Windows XP Professional x64 Edition
  Windows Vista x64 Edition
  Windows 7 x64 Edition

* Computer 
  Any computer which runs the above operating system software properly. 
  And the USB port is required:


Cautions, Limitations and Restrictions
======================================
1. Make sure that you have adequate disk space available when scanning large 
   documents at high resolutions. For instance, scanning a full page color 
   document at 600 dpi requires a minimum of 300MB of free disk space.

2. Only run one application at a time that is actively linked to ScanGear. 
   Do not open more than one application that is actively linked to ScanGear. 
   Also, do not open ScanGear more than once to acquire an image in the same 
   application.

3. When scanning large images at high resolutions, the progress bar may stop 
   at 0% or your computer may stop responding, depending on the size of the file 
   and the limitations of the applications being used. If this happens, cancel 
   the action (for example by clicking the progress bar's cancel button), and 
   then increase the virtual memory available and perform the scan again. 
   Selecting smaller area at lower resolutions may also resolve the problem. 
   Also, you can scan the image from the Toolbox and import the resulting file 
   into your application.

4. The TWAIN data source may not open correctly from time to time when the system 
   file is in the NTFS format. For security reasons, the TWAIN module cannot be 
   written to the "winnt" directory. For details, contact your system 
   administrator.

5. Always close the ScanGear main window before you exit the parent application 
   program.

6. Certain personal computers (including laptops) may not restart correctly from 
   standby mode when the printer is attached. If this occurs, please restart your 
   computer.

7. You may not be able to use the [Start] key on the machine after you install 
   the driver.
   In this case, restart your computer.

8. When you preview or scan an image with a relatively uniform background, the 
   Auto Tone function may change its coloring. If this occurs, reset the Auto 
   Tone.

9. Some applications may close ScanGear automatically after scanning.

10.Some application programs may hide the TWAIN user interface. In this case, 
   refer to the application programer's manual to find out the required setting 
   changes to show the TWAIN user interface.

11.When scanning full page images into a Microsoft Office application (such as 
   Word, PowerPoint or Excel), it is recommended that you use the Custom Insert 
   command in the Insert Picture from Scanner or Camera dialog box. The image may 
   otherwise not be scanned correctly.

12.Some applications, such as Microsoft Word 2000, Excel 2000 and PowerPoint 2000,
   will not allow scanning of multi-page documents. These applications will only 
   accept the first page scanned. In this case, please scan each page 
   individually.

13.Images imported from Corel WordPerfect 10 may not be imported correctly. If 
   this happens, increase the virtual memory available and scan the image again. 
   This should solve the problem.

14.Some applications supporting for PC Scanning might be unable to scan documents 
   continuously by using the ADF. In this case, please scan documents by using 
   the Platen Glass.

15.For Windows XP/Vista/7, when scanning a document from the feeder using 
   "Paint", place only one document in the feeder.
   If multiple documents are placed, the following problems occur.
   - The second and subsequent sheets of document are not scanned.
   - After all the documents are scanned, <Canceled.> appears in the display.
   - The next scanning cannot be performed.

TWAIN Toolkit Disclaimer and Limitations
========================================
The TWAIN Toolkit is distributed as is. The developer and distributors of the 
TWAIN Toolkit expressly disclaim all implied, express or statutory warranties 
including, without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability, 
noninfringement of third party rights and fitness for a particular purpose. 
Neither the developers nor the distributors will be liable for damages, 
whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential, as a result of 
the reproduction, modification, distribution or other use of the TWAIN Toolkit.
