BT-Sim
===================
Urs Hunkeler <urs.hunkeler@gmail.com> - current maintainer

BT-Sim is a  BlueTooth simulator on a HCI level. The project alows to develop
and test BT applications without using real BT hardware. It works in particular
with PalmSource's Palm OS Simulator.

More information is available at the project web site:
http://btsim.sourceforge.net/

Compile
=======
I recommend ant (http://ant.apache.org) to compile this project:

ant compile

If you really want to compile the program without using ant, you can do so
by using a command similar to:

find src -name "*.java" -exec javac -deprecation -d build/classes {} \;

Running
=======

You can start the program either using ant:

ant run

or using the command-line (for instance to pass arguments):

java -cp build/classes net.sf.btsim.BTSim

The program will (by default) listen on port 7007. So make sure that whatever
program you want to use with this BlueTooth simulator it will try to
connect to this port. With PalmSource's Palm OS Simulator, you need
to specify something like 'localhost:7007' as the craddle's port.

Creating a JAR file
===================
If you're using ant, creating a JAR file is easy:

ant jar

The file will be placed in the build/lib directory. This is an executable
jar file. This means that it knows about the project's main class and
can be executed with a command similar to this:

java -jar btsim-0.3.jar

On windows one might be able to start it by double-clicking on the icon.

Creating the documentation
==========================
If you are using ant, you can generate the class documentation with this
command:

ant javadoc

The documentation will be a series of HTML files in the usual javadoc format.
You can find them in the build/doc directory.
