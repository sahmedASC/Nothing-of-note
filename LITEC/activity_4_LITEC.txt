(Part 1)
1. Did you notice any change in the output?
    -No significant changed was noticed. The voltage did not change much.
2. Would this circuit be useful as an input to a system?
    -It's difficult to say whether any configuration is not useful.
    In a practical sense this circuit is not useful since the input does
    not change a present state to the system. However this circuit may be useful
    for a user to add artifical noise to their system for demonstration or testing purposes.

(Part 2)
1. Did you notice any change in the output?
    -A change was noticed. The voltage went from roughly the supply level down to 0V.
2. Would this circuit be useful as an input to a system?
    -Yes this circuit would be very useful as an input to a system because
    this voltage change can be used to disable chips in specfic instances and
    overall add more control to a system by being a temporary OFF switch.

Pushbutton State | "Input Value"
--------------------------------
Pressed          | 0
Released         | 1

(Part 3)
1. Did you notice any change in the output?
    - A change was noticed. The voltage went from 0V to roughly the supply voltage.
2.Would this circuit be useful as an input to a system?
    -Yes this circuit would be very useful as an input to a system because
    this voltage change can be used to start system by giving them power.
    This would add control to the system by being a temporary ON switch.
Truth Table
Pushbutton State | "Input Value"
--------------------------------
Pressed          | 1
Released         | 0

(Part 4)
1. You should have noticed that one of the circuits built in steps 2 and 3 produced an 
inverted response to the pushbutton press. Why?
    -This is due to the placement of the resistor. In step 2 the released push button made
    the circuit open so the 5V had direct path to the input. However when it was pressed the input
    Was connected across a wire which by definition has 0V across it ideally. The opposite is true
    for step 3. This is because the push button connected the 5V to the resistor which then had 5V
    across it and passed that to the input.

(Part 5)
   PB1   |    PB2   | SS1 | Input 1 | Input 2
---------------------------------------------
Released | Released | Off |    0    |    0    
Pressed  | Released | Off |    0    |    0    
Released | Pressed  | Off |    0    |    0    
Pressed  | Pressed  | Off |    0    |    0    
Released | Released | On  |    0    |    0   
Pressed  | Released | On  |    1    |    0    
Released | Pressed  | On  |    0    |    1    
Pressed  | Pressed  | On  |    1    |    1    

1. While this “complex” circuit above demonstrates the possibilities for building logic with switches
(and in the same vein, transistors), the usefulness of such a structure is reduced when using a microcontroller. 
Assuming you have three independent inputs within a program, PB1, PB2, and SS1, which are all independent of each other, 
what is the effective binary (Boolean) logic commands that could be used to generate the equivalent value for 
variable Input_2 in terms of AND (&), OR (|), and NOT (~) operations?
    -Input 2 = PB2 & SS1

(Part 6)
   PB1   |    PB2   | SS1 | Input 1 | Input 2 | LED 1 | BiLED1 
--------------------------------------------------------------
Released | Released | Off |    0    |    0    |  OFF  |  OFF   
Pressed  | Released | Off |    0    |    0    |  OFF  |  OFF   
Released | Pressed  | Off |    0    |    0    |  OFF  |  OFF   
Pressed  | Pressed  | Off |    0    |    0    |  OFF  |  OFF   
Released | Released | On  |    0    |    0    |  OFF  |  OFF   
Pressed  | Released | On  |    1    |    0    |  ON   |  GREEN 
Released | Pressed  | On  |    0    |    1    |  ON   |  RED   
Pressed  | Pressed  | On  |    1    |    1    |  ON   |  OFF   

1. What the states of Input_1 and Input_2 that cause the BiLED1 to be off and why?
    -The states that cause it to be off are when the both are released or when they both are
    pressed. If they are both are released then there is no voltage or current flowing so it 
    clearly does not turn on. But if both are on then there is no voltage across the component
    so still no current flows.
